                    A Web developer is a kind of programmer who specializes in the development of applications relating to the World Wide Web 
                    or distributed network applications, which typically run protocols like HTTP from a Web server to a client browser 
                    using associated programming languages like HTML/CSS, C#, Ruby and PHP to name a few. A Web developer is usually concerned with the 
                    back end or the programming aspect of creating a website or Web application and is not to be confused with a Web designer, who only 
                    deals with the aesthetics of a website or application, although many professionals have both skill sets.
